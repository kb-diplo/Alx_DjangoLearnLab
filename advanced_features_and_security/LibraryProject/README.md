1. Custom User Model Implementation
The default Django user model has been replaced with a custom model that includes additional fields:

date_of_birth: Stores the user's date of birth
profile_photo: Stores the user's profile image

Key Files:

models.py: Contains the custom user model extending AbstractUser
admin.py: Configured to manage the custom user model
settings.py: Updated with AUTH_USER_MODEL pointing to the custom model

2. Permissions and Groups Management
Custom permissions have been implemented to control access to application features:
Implemented Permissions:

can_view: Permission to view content
can_create: Permission to create new content
can_edit: Permission to modify existing content
can_delete: Permission to remove content

User Groups:

Editors: Users who can create and edit content
Viewers: Users who can only view content
Admins: Users with full access to all features

Key Files:

models.py: Defines custom permissions
views.py: Implements permission checks using decorators
Admin interface: Configured for managing user groups and permissions

3. Security Best Practices
The application implements multiple security enhancements:
Django Settings Security:

DEBUG = False in production
Secure cookie configurations
XSS protection filters
Content type security headers
CSRF protection

Form Security:

All forms include CSRF tokens
Input validation and sanitization

Data Access Security:

Parameterized queries via Django ORM
Secure handling of user input

Content Security Policy:

CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

4. HTTPS Implementation
The application is configured to enforce HTTPS:
Security Configurations:

SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True: Forces HTTPS connections
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000: HTTP Strict Transport Security
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True: HSTS for all subdomains
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True: Allows HSTS preloading

Cookie Security:

SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True: Secure session cookies
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True: Secure CSRF cookies

Additional Security Headers:

X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY": Prevents clickjacking
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True: Prevents MIME-type sniffing
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True: Browser XSS protection
